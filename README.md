Hi. My name is Ioan Ciulei, using Jhon Choulay as it's the closest sounding english name.
I am 17 boy living in Romania, passioned about art, animation and music mainly.
Realisticly speaking, there are two projects.
First, the game. I worked with my friend to make a game in Godot, as C++ was the coding language we learn in school at this moment. 
Running the game should be as easy as downloading the game from his fork here: https://github.com/FattestCatto/the-hackathon-game and running the game.exe,
assuming he exported the project. In case he did not export the project in the repository, you will have to import the downloaded fork in Godot as a project, then use the run button.
The game is in a state. My friend does not seem much interested in the game anymore, so you could call it a dead project. But I liked the work I put we put in it.
Now my personal one. It is located in this repo, at https://github.com/JhonChoulay/The-hackathon-game-art/tree/main/Personal-creations/Music 
I am working on doing a small album, if you want to call it that. A small colection of quick, made in one to two hours, with a chill, downtempo vibe.
Running them should be as easy as running the .wav files. I will post the whole album on youtube, soundcloud and maybe spotify, but it will probably be past the arcade's end.
I love these two projects. The timing of the arcade was bad for me, lots of work on the house, familly problems etc. I don't want atention, nor any benefits for having problems.
These are the projects. Shout out to Daniel (FattestCatto) for coding most, if not all of the game and, more importantly, for informing me about the arcade. I wouldn't have any idea about it without him.
